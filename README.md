# Productiva
Productiva allows users to control all aspects of product production. It contains a variety of options where users can add new products or select existing products and record them into the production log. It offers complete visibility and traceability of the entire manufacturing process, giving you real-time visibility and control over your entire manufacturing supply chain.

 - Productiva is a product management system that provides discrete and advanced quality 			management and product lifecycle management.	
 - This production management system was created independently by Jaysson Balbuena with the contribution of Robert Kissinger (TA).
 - It took approximately four months to build this project, and it was designed for an assignment or final project.
 - The level of experience before developing "Productiva" was slightly low. The current level of experience has risen incredibly.
 - The idea of creating "Productiva" came from Prof. Vanselow, who assigned a group of students from Florida Gulf Coast University to develop a product management system for a final project (course COP 3030).
 - For this software, most of the development process was produced at home under a critical social condition.

 - I'd like to express my special thanks of gratitude to one of the TA's of this course, Robert Kissinger, and one of my classmates, William Angola, who helped me and provided support in completing my project.
 - I would also like to extend my gratitude to my professor Vanselow for providing me with all the facilities that were required.

## History


## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

 - Objects and classes
		-Productiva is constructed based on objects and classes that represent the states and 			behaviors of this software.  
 - Fundamental concepts of database
		 -H2 Relational Database is utilized to store users input data and production history.
 - Enums and Interfaces
		-Throughout this software, a number of immutable variables and unimplemented methods are utilized for security, abstraction, and inheritance purposes.
 - Abstract classes and inheritance
		 - To maintain reliability, Productiva uses abstract classes, which are essential for this purpose. Inheritance comes in handy when the system needs to manoeuvre or manipulate the behaviors of the abstract's class. 
 - Exception Handling
		 -Productiva won't let you down even though you provide her a wrong input, and this is thanks to exception handling.
 - Polymorphism
-Productiva has many different forms of how to manipulate data. Overriding methods are      explicitly generated in the ProductionRecord's class that forms part of Polymorphism.
 - Encapsulation 
		-Key pilar for object-oriented designs. Encapsulation helps Productiva to restrict the direct access to its properties and behaviors.
 - Arrays and Collections
	-Productiva uses arrays and collections to store a large quantity of data such as employees and products objects.
 - Regular Expressions
		-Regex very util and excellent tool that helps “Productiva” avoid unwanted input.
 - Recursion
		-Productiva uses this technique to reverse strings.
