# Productiva
Productiva allows users to control all aspects of product production. It contains a variety of options where users can add new products or select existing products that can be produced and record them into the production log. It offers complete visibility and traceability of the entire manufacturing process, giving you real-time visibility and control over your entire manufacturing supply chain.

 - Productiva is a product management system that provides discrete and advanced quality 			management and product lifecycle management.	
 - This product management system was created independently by Jaysson Balbuena with the contribution of Robert Kissinger (TA).
 - It took approximately four months to build this software, and it was designed for a final project.
 - The level of experience before developing "Productiva" was slightly low. The current level of experience has risen incredibly.
 - The idea of creating "Productiva" came from Prof. Vanselow, who assigned a group of students from Florida Gulf Coast University to develop a product management system for a final project (course COP 3030).
 - Most of the development process was produced at home.

## Contributing

Productiva is not a full, complete product management system. Many features can still be added to it. For example, Productiva can be
improved by accepting more item types. Also, Productiva can meet other objectives such as tracking improvement on new products, having a display tab where it shows all the requirements for each product, a delivery tab, and some others. Of course, anyone who has similar or better ideas can contribute to this project.

 - I'd like to express my special thanks of gratitude to one of the TA's of this course, Robert Kissinger, and one of my classmates, William Angola, who helped me and provided support in completing my project.
 - I would also like to extend my gratitude to my professor Vanselow for providing me with all the facilities that were required.

## History


## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

 - Objects and classes
		-Productiva is constructed based on objects and classes that represent its states and 			behaviors.  
 - Fundamental concepts of database
		 -H2 Relational Database is utilized to store new products and production history.
 - Enums and Interfaces
		-Throughout this software, a number of immutable variables and unimplemented methods are utilized for security, abstraction, and inheritance purposes.
 - Abstract classes and inheritance
		 - To maintain reliability, Productiva uses abstract classes, which are essential for this purpose. Inheritance comes in handy when the system needs to manoeuvre or manipulate the behaviors of the abstract's class. 
 - Exception Handling
		 -Productiva will not crash on you even though if you enter a wrong input, and this is thanks to exception handling.
 - Polymorphism
-Productiva has many forms of how to manipulate and instantiate objects. For instance, in the ProductionRecord's class, overriding methods change the shape of objects in different ways which form part of Polymorphism.
 - Encapsulation 
		-Key pilar of object-oriented programming. Encapsulation helps Productiva to restrict the direct access to its properties and behaviors.
 - Arrays and Collections
	-Productiva uses arrays and collections to store a large quantity of data such as employees and products objects.
 - Regular Expressions
		-Regex very util and excellent tool that helps “Productiva” avoid unwanted input.
 - Recursion
		-Productiva uses this technique to reverse strings mainly used for security purposes.
